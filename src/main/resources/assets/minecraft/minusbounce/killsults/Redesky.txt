You're so bad that if I played with you, I'd be losing every single game
There's not enough adjectives to describe how bad you are
Here's your ticket to spectator mode
You're that kind of non-recycable trash that no one knows what to do with
Are your hands freezing? Because you missed every single hit
I must be in a deranked game if I'm in the lobby with you, %name%
I'm not hacking it's just my 871619-B21 HP Intel Xeon 8180 2.5GHz DL380 G10 processor
When people play with you, it's considered charity work
I know you're rage quitting but with that aim, you'd be having trouble clicking the disconnect button
I don't care about the fact that I'm hacking I just care how you died in a block game
Your gaming chair expired mid-fight so that's how you lost %name%
You're so special that you can be the password requirement
%name% is the type of person who climbs over a glass wall to see what's on the other side
It's a bird! It's a plane! No it's your rank falling!
*yawn* I get so bored playing against you. That's okay though
Damn you have the awareness of a sloth
That aim is so trash I think the safest place to stand is in front of you
